# Written Assignment

## Overview
At QuikNode, we value passion, progress, humility, trust and excellence. For the first part of our interview process, we have you write up a short strategy for debugging this thin client around the Ethereum RPC: https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API. There is no coding necessary and we in fact do not need you to write any code for this exercise, just tell us what the problems you find are and how you figured them out using written communication.

What we're selecting for at this step is clarity of thought, ability to communicate and humility. How clear is your writing? What are the items that you consider when working through a bug? Are you willing to invest the time necessary to help us understand your abilities?

> Note: It's important to note that we will not use your work here for anything other than evaluation. This piece of code was ripped out from our codebase because it was problematic in the past but is already fixed.

We would like for you to take 15-20 minutes to review this repo as it stands and 40-45 minutes to write up a short description of the problems and how you figured out those were the problems. There is not much to consider and we want to hear every idea you had and how you arrived at your conclusions.

Without further ado, here is the repo as it would be provided to you by one of our developers:

## QuikClient: A tool for fetching block height

Hacked this together last night on my dev machine and we're shipping to prod later this week. Need someone to operationalize this and debug it before we ship.
